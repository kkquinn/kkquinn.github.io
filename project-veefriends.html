            <h1>Key Accomplishments at VeeFriends</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.veefriends.com/burn-island" target="_blank">Live Demo of Burn Island Portal</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.veefriends.com/profile" target="_blank">Live Demo of Profile Management</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>At VeeFriends, I was instrumental in building several key features that significantly improved the user experience and functionality of the website. This included the creation of the Burn Island portal and the profile management system.</p>
            <p>These projects were built using Razor components to create composable UI elements, and Blazor WASM with SignalR for real-time communication between the client (browser) and server. This approach allowed for a highly interactive and responsive user interface.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built the Burn Island landing page and details pages on the <a href="https://www.veefriends.com/burn-island" target="_blank">VeeFriends website</a>.</li>
                <li>Worked closely with the marketing team to implement SEO descriptions and tags for all pages, improving the site's visibility and ranking in search engine results.</li>
                <li>Lead the team in ensuring the website was responsive and mobile-first, optimizing the site for visitors using a variety of devices.</li>
            </ul>
